The programs in this repository are for a class where I learned to understand and use ARMv8 assembly code
For the assignments in this class we were given an ARMv8 emulator that would understand and assist us in disassembling assembly code.
The emulator is attached in this repository as legv8emul.

To run cyclesort.legv8asm, all you do in the terminal is run "/legv8asm cyclesort.legv8asm" This will output numbers in a sorted order for the user to read.
There will be hexadecimal output as well that gives the user feedback on the numbers that were outputted.

Programming 2 folder will have its own readme explaining how to use the disassembler.
